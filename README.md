# Dependency Installer for Archaic Systems

- tiny set of Bash scripts
- no root privileges required
- easily extensible

Find the [manual here](MANUAL.md).

## Description

This repository holds a very basic, Bash script based dependency installer.

Its goal is to help you bootstrap your software on ancient systems, typically encountered when using clusters or other HPC systems.
There are other, similar solutions available -- some of them require root, some don't -- yet, this one is far less complex.

It is recommended to copy the dependency installer into your project and adapt what you need.
